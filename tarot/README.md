# Tarot prompts

An adaptation of the book _Tarot Shadow Work_ by Christine Jette, and inspired by [Vox Profunda](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514154/vox-profunda) by [Man Alone](https://www.youtube.com/@amanisalone).

1. Clone https://github.com/krates98/tarotcardapi.git and copy the `images` directory to this directory.

2. Run `bash draw.sh` to draw a Tarot card and see a prompt from _Tarot Shadow Work_.

3. Seeing the card image: if your terminal has the `imgcat` command (which I believe is equivalent to saying you are using iTerm2 on macOS), you will see the card inline in the terminal. Else you can open it another way, perhaps by replacing line 7 with `open images/$fname`.
